'''
Given a value V, if we want to make a change for V cents, and we have an infinite supply of each of 
C = { C1, C2, .., Cm} valued coins, what is the minimum number of coins to make the change? 
If itâ€™s not possible to make a change, print -1.

Input: coins[] = {25, 10, 5}, V = 30
Output: Minimum 2 coins required
We can use one coin of 25 cents and one of 5 cents 

Input: coins[] = {9, 6, 5, 1}, V = 11
Output: Minimum 2 coins required
We can use one coin of 6 cents and 1 coin of 5 cents

The minimum number of coins for a value V can be computed using the below recursive formula. 

If V == 0, then 0 coins required.
If V > 0
   minCoins(coins[0..m-1], V) = min {1 + minCoins(V-coin[i])} 
                               where i varies from 0 to m-1 
                               and coin[i] <= V
